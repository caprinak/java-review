A map is an associate array data structure

Hashing: transformation of a string of character to a shorted fixed-lenght
 value that represents original string.
 a shorter value helps in indexing and faster searches
 In java every object has a method public int hashcode() that will return a hash value for a given project
 
 Not Thread-safe
 Iterator not guaranteed in insertion order
 
 Need to use synchronized operations when manipulating from multiple threads , no worries about perfromance overhead
 Node<K,V>[] table;
 
 int hash;
 K key;
 V value;
 Node<K,V> next;
 >>> linked list 
 >>> each table is a bucket
 
 
 HASHTABLE
 Legacy associative array implementation; Inducted to collection family
 All methods are 'thread-safe"
 there is synchronized keyword on each public method (put, get, remove)
 overhead in an environment where Map is initialized once and the read by multiple threads
