similar to HashMap
Iteration is guaranteed in insertion order
Maintains seperate doubly linked list of all entries that is kept in entry insertion order
Can be used in use-cases where hash map like behavior is needed at the same time order of insertion has to be preserved

TreeMap
Implementation of SortedMap and NavigableMap
Iteration is guaranteed in "natural sorted" order of keys
keys should implement "Comparable" interface (if not throw ClassCastException)
Or we need to provide Comparator in constructor.

red-black tree based implementation 

IdentityHashMap

EnumMap
EnumMap<K extends Enum<K>,V>
for use with enum type keys
does not fail-fast
null keys not permitted. not synchronized
